# Tej's Configurations

This branch holds the configurations on the Raspberry Pi that acted as the Internet Service Provider for all edge networks connected in the schema. The ISP provided connection fowarding and DNS resolving to the edge networks through configurations on frrouting and BGP. This allowed our edge networks to communicate and share nameserver records freely throughout the intranet environment.
